                                                                HTML
HTML is organized as a collection of family tree relationships. When an element is contained inside another element, it is considered the "child" of that element. The child element is said to be "nested" inside of the "parent" element. 

Example:

<body>
  <h1>Hello World</h1>
  <p>This paragraph is a child of the body element</p>
  <div>
    
  </div> 
</body>

the <body> element is the parent element of the <div> element, and both the <h1> and <p> elements are the child elements nested in the <div> element. <h1> and <p> are at the same level, so they are considered siblings and are both grandchildren of the <body> 

<div> element (short for division) container that divides the page into sections
